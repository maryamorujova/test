	<h2> New ways to wear the scarf </h2> 

	<p> Traditional scarf can be worn in many ways. Historically women have been wearing over theri head for a numaber of reasons. It coudl be religious, as in many muslim ocuntires women cover their hair in different ways, or for some, it was cultural. It was a beatiful garment that I woman could wear to match with her other clothing. This garment would also protect the wearer from intense sun if they lived in a semi desert, and sand storms or even protect them from cold if they lived in snowy regions of the country.

	Traditionally some women would also choose to wear it over their shoulders and in the modern day it has become more common to do so. Women also come up with creative ways to wear the scarf. You caqn see some pull it through their dresses if the dress has a belt or a ribbon to make it seem like its part of the dress. Some like to wear the silk scarf like a summer top if it is wrapped like an 'X' over theri chest, which is somewhat less common to see as its still a Muslim country. There are occasions when it woudl be worn aroudn the neck intead of a woven winter scarf to protect one from cold nights.

	Another extremely popular and unique way to use the scarf for the past decade was ot wear it over the swimsuit. The long versions of te scarf can easily act as a perfect pareo, also known as sarong, which basially acts as a cover up over a swimsuit. The function is to keep a person warm once they are out of water, but not as warm as a towel would be. It also allows peopel to enter stores and cafes without revealing their swimsuit as some might find it undesirable or not comfortable to do. Some wear it a full body covering sarong; whereas, others choose to wear it as a skirt sarong if they just want to stay longer on the coast and enjoy the breeze that gently forms continuous waves on the silky sarong skirt.
